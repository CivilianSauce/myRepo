The Unicode representation for an "empty" or "invisible" text character typically refers to a **zero-width space (ZWSP)**. Its Unicode code point is:

* **U+200B** (Zero Width Space)

This character doesn't produce any visible output but can be used in text to insert a space where it's invisible. Itâ€™s often used in formatting, for example, to prevent word breaking, or for obfuscation purposes.
